#Second Lesson Deployment

This lesson is mostly and extension of the classification example of lesson one. But is more concerned with creating an end-to-end product/Model.
Initially the lesson is about little hints and tips are would not be of interest for this blog.

Something that surprised me was the fact that we can train the model before cleaning up the images. However, the explanation seemed to indicate the opposite with sizing being done before training the system. I will need to revisit this idea as Iâ€™m not sure on the correct order. The idea of cleaning as it turns out is different to the idea of shaping an image. I had that distinction wrong.

Prediction/actual/loss/probability seems to be a very important idea that I think may even come up in the exam. Some further reading about this that may be useful. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342093739_WasteNet_Waste_Classification_at_the_Edge_for_Smart_Bins
Because the model is built before cleaning it helps to determine how to clean the data set.

I am particularly happy with how Brian has adapted this course. So that we are not doing work on our own machine. I see the reasoning behind running of a local system. But given the issues, the fact that we have code spaces to run out assignment on is much appreciated.
I think I will revisit the concept on working locally at another time. But for the purposes of this course, running everything via code spaces and on a browser is easier.
Regarding the second question of the assignment, I originally thought that I needed to make 10 different programs for 10 different models. However, rereading the sheet and watching this lecture. I can see that I need to take this example and classify 10 different animals at once. I have downloaded a sample notebook to work off. I plan to use that file to create new notebooks. I wonder why we are building in notebooks not just writing code in a program like anaconda. And then writing about it. I assume that the notebook will make it easy to write the assignment as one file. But if the submission is the same as previous assignments, then that won't work. Something to look into.

This set up is very confusing local git, google drive, workbooks, notebooks, blogs, anaconda, conda, shells, running locally. The content is interesting, but the need to be running and play with so many different programs and systems really turns me off from wanting to go any further after this course. I like one program to do my work in, one program to write about it. A brave new world, that I'm sure I'll need to learn about. but for right now at uni this does not fell worth my time or quickly diminishing brainpower.

I am currently having issues making this blog appear on my website. As the website does not show up. The lesson did give me some things to try. I will attempt to have a working blog by the time I write the next one.

Until next time.
