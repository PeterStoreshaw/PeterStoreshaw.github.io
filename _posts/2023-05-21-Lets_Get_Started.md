#Lets Get Started

I got started on Q2.

Mostly I was able to use the code provided by the Fast Ai course.
However in code spaces I was having some issues with downloading the phots and the learn function would crash with more then 3 animals to classify.
So, I figured out how to use google colab, it was much faster, and I will use that with the GPU form now on. It does mean that my file will be located in my personal repository (I cannot access the course repository) but I can move it once I am done.
To make the system better, I manually went into the downloaded files and deleted any pictures that did not fit.

1. For the bird folder there were an awful lot of lamps.
2. For the cat folder there were some lamps, but a very large amount of sunglasses and some moderately disturbing cartoons.
3. The lamps were back again in force for the elephants. Does duck duck go have a thing for lamps? When I search in google, I barely get any.
4. The lamps, the lamps, if I see one more lamp, I may go insane. Oh, also there was fishing in the fish folder.
5. The frog folder needed the least amount of culling. I did leave a few cartoons, but hopefully they will not affect the system. 
6. The gorilla folder had two interesting things, first lots of kidâ€™s playgrounds to be removed. Second lots of the gorilla photos also had people in them which I did not remove. I intended to check my system with some human photos. I wonder if they will be classed as gorillas.
7. The insect folder will be interesting. Lots of photos removed there. It is such a broad category that it may be hard for the system to classify. We will see.
8. The kangaroo folder was by far the worst. Some of the images were wallabies. Duck duck go is truly broken.
9. Koala, THE LAMPS ARE BACK!!!
10. Lastly the lizard luckily. I will now have a breakdown every time a see a lamp.

This data set is now saved in my google drive so I can use the same one each time. 
I a have included the confusion matrix and understand how it works. The system is reasonable accurate. I have not begun to implement T-SNE which I will do next time.
