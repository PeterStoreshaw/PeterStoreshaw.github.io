#The first lesson from Prof Jeremy Howard

The primary takawy from the first example Jeremy goes through in the first 10 minutes is how quiclky the feild of deep learning is progressing. The level of progress from 2015 to 2022 is astounding. The development and invention of the AI art is interesting, though I have several ethical qualms. Initially Jeremy seems to be giddy to the idea of AI models and their progress without thought on the significant issues involved. Regarding the art models the plagerism of collective works and removal of work from a human seems to be frightening rather then encouraged. The link to an ethical course is to be commended but feels to be far to little effort in comparison to the enthusiasm for the rest of the material.

Fetures are thing that I stuggle to understand. Is it a catch all term or a spesfic thing. https://www.alibabacloud.com/tech-news/deep-learning/4l1w5hzopcc-what-are-the-characteristics-of-deep-learning

The link helped clarify a little bit, but I fear that nural networks, fetures and combined systems will take some time for me to learn.

I enjoyed the description of practicality. As a UQ electrical engineer the amount to contect I have learned that will almost certinly have not practical use is saggering. It is ammusing that industry relises this and yet universities insist on outdated teacing.

Onto the real deep learning. The bird example seems quite stright forward and much easier then previous assignments, however I suspect that work already done for us is extramly difficult and complex.

The comparison between machine learning and a computer model is interesting and informative. I can understand how the weighting works but I think I will need some time playing with the models.

This is all for lecture one. Next I will blog about attempting to use the bird model example to clasify other animals.
