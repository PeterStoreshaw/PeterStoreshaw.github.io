#The first lesson from Prof Jeremy Howard

The primary takeaway from the first example Jeremy goes through in the first 10 minutes is how quickly the field of deep learning is progressing. The level of progress from 2015 to 2022 is astounding. The development and invention of the AI art is interesting, though I have several ethical qualms. Initially Jeremy seems to be giddy to the idea of AI models and their progress without thought on the significant issues involved. Regarding the art models the plagiarism of collective works and removal of work from a human seems to be frightening rather than encouraged. The link to an ethical course is to be commended but feels to be far too little effort in comparison to the enthusiasm for the rest of the material.

Features are thing that I struggle to understand. Is it a catch all term or a specific thing. https://www.alibabacloud.com/tech-news/deep-learning/4l1w5hzopcc-what-are-the-characteristics-of-deep-learning
The link helped clarify a little bit, but I fear that neural networks, features and combined systems will take some time for me to learn.

I enjoyed the description of practicality. As a UQ electrical engineer the amount to content I have learned that will almost certainly have not practical use is staggering. It is amusing that industry realises this and yet universities insist on outdated teaching.
Onto the real deep learning. The bird example seems quite straight forward and much easier than previous assignments, however I suspect that work already done for us is extremely difficult and complex.
The comparison between machine learning and a computer model is interesting and informative. I can understand how the weighting works, but I think I will need some time playing with the models.

This is all for lecture one. Next, I will blog about attempting to use the bird model example to classify other animals.
