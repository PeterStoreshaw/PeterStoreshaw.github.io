#Lesson Three and Why You Should Read Instructions

First off, it pays to actully read instructions. I did not name my blog correctly the first time and as such it did not publish online. I have fixed the issue and it should be up now.

Lesson 3, now we get into neural networks. 
Different architectures to build a model makes sense, however how to chose your architecture does not. 
Looking at a graph and deciding to try somthing based on speed vs accuracy, but that not really being and indicator of usfulness, means I don't realy understand how to chose how to build our model.

Losss function is a way to determine how good the model is at a given time, It can be used to tweek the model with the system dissregarding changes that make the model worse.
It will be a function we will need to impliment in the assignment and I assume I will use the MSE function as it is a fucntion I have heard of and used before in other courses.

The mathamatical example was clear however, as an asside I still do not like it when a person is trying to explain a thing, that has a realworld example and insists on useing some basic theoretical math. 

It is important to train the model as soon as posible as it will help you to determing how to continue to purue the project. By doing it early you can even compleltly change your solution before wasting to much time. 

I for the most part followed what was happening, and im sure it was important. But given I dont have a great interest in deep learninf the data work done in the tables was insanley boring. 
Though I do appreciate that it demonstrated the how different models can be produced.

In addition to the first three lessons I have  begun to look at Q2 of the assignment. Where I need to build  a model that can detect 10 different animal species.
So far I have tried to create a blank file and code in it. Only to realise we should be using a Notbook. 
Today I have coppied the "is it a bird" notebook and slightly edited it to figure our how to commit in codespaces. 
After trial and error I have determined the folowing method. 

1. Do somthing to the notebook to be changed
2. In coloumn on the left select the chages tab
3. Press the + button to select changes
4. Press commit 
5. Make sure to add some form of commit message, IT CANNOT BE BLANK.
6. Push the commit.
7. When finished press the blue box in the lower left
8. From the menu that appers at the middle top, select close codespace.

Next blog will be my thoughts on the first section of creating a model for question 3.

Untill then.
