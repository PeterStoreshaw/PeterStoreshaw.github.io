#Lesson Three and Why You Should Read Instructions

First off, it pays to actually read instructions. I did not name my blog correctly the first time and as such it did not publish online. I have fixed the issue and it should be up now.
Lesson 3, now we get into neural networks. Different architectures to build a model makes sense, however, how to choose your architecture does not. Looking at a graph and deciding to try something based on speed vs accuracy, but that not really being and indicator of usefulness, means I don't really understand how to choose how to build our model.

Loss function is a way to determine how good the model is at a given time; it can be used to tweak the model with the system disregarding changes that make the model worse. It will be a function we will need to implement in the assignment, and I assume I will use the MSE function as it is a function I have heard of and used before in other courses.

The mathematical example was clear however, as an aside I still do not like it when a person is trying to explain a thing, which has a real-world example and insists on using some basic theoretical math.
It is important to train the model as soon as possible as it will help you to determine how to continue to pursue the project. By doing it early you can even completely change your solution before wasting too much time.
I for the most part followed what was happening, and I’m sure it was important. But given I don’t have a great interest in deep learning the data work done in the tables was insanely boring. Though I do appreciate that it demonstrated the how different models can be produced.

In addition to the first three lessons, I have begun to look at Q2 of the assignment. Where I need to build a model that can detect 10 different animal species. So far, I have tried to create a blank file and code in it. Only to realise we should be using a Notebook.

Today I have copied the "is it a bird" notebook and slightly edited it to figure out how to commit in code spaces. After trial and error, I have determined the following method.
1.	Do something to the notebook to be changed.
2.	In column on the left select the changes tab
3.	Press the + button to select changes.
4.	Press commit
5.	Make sure to add some form of commit message, IT CANNOT BE BLANK.
6.	Push the commit.
7.	When finished press the blue box in the lower left.
8.	From the menu that appears at the middle top, select close code space.
Next blog will be my thoughts on the first section of creating a model for question 3.

Until then.
